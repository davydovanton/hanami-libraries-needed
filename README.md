Please create issues for the library you need or want from Hanami and let me know if you have any thoughts on the management of this list.

If you are in doubt about the availability of some feature or other, please check
[Awesome Hanami](https://github.com/davydvoanton/awesome-hanami).

If you want to attack one of the issues, let me know and i'll "assign" it to you, and include a link to your repo

Cheers Anton
